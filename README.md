# 📊 Channel Profitability Analysis (Power BI)

This project analyzes revenue, cost structure, and profitability performance by sales channel using Power BI. The objective was to evaluate whether higher revenue necessarily translates into higher profitability and to identify strategic improvement opportunities.

## Business Context

The reseller channel generates the majority of total revenue. However, initial analysis suggested that it might not contribute proportionally to overall profit. This project investigates revenue distribution, cost impact, profit margins, margin gaps between channels, and long-term performance trends to support strategic decision-making.

## Methodology

The analysis was built using Power BI with DAX measures to calculate key financial indicators:

- **Profit** = Revenue − Cost  
- **Margin %** = Profit ÷ Revenue  
- **Margin Gap (p.p.)** = Margin (Internet) − Margin (Reseller)

The dashboard was structured into four pages:
1. Executive Overview  
2. Revenue Analysis  
3. Cost Analysis  
4. Profitability & Strategic Insight  

## Key Findings

- The Reseller channel drives most of the company’s revenue.
- Despite high revenue, its margin remains consistently below 1%.
- The Internet channel maintains margins above 40%.
- The margin gap exceeds 40 percentage points.
- Margin trend analysis suggests structural inefficiencies in the reseller model.

The findings highlight that revenue concentration does not necessarily indicate profitability efficiency.

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

- Reevaluate reseller pricing strategy.
- Optimize cost structure within the reseller channel.
- Review contract and discount policies.
- Increase investment in higher-margin channels.
